  <caption>This is a great Greek-inspired salad with chicken souvlaki, romaine, bell pepper, cucumber, and tomatoes served with tzatziki dressing.</caption>

  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon greek seasoning</li>
    <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
    <li>2 cloves, garlic, finely grated or minced</li>
    <li>1 pound boneless chicken breasts, quartered lengthwise</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons tzatziki sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons, fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>1 head romain, trimmed, washed and torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>1/2 cup thinly, sliced red bell pepper </li>
    <li>1/2 english cucumber, sliced</li>
    <li>8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, Greek seasoning, lemon juice, and garlic in a large glass bowl; mix well. Add chicken to marinade and turn to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but not longer than 4 hours. </li>
    <li>Mix together tzatziki, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl until well combined. Refrigerate salad dressing until needed. </li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
    <li>Remove chicken from marinade and place on the preheated grill. Cook for 5 minutes. Flip chicken over and continue grilling until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Discard excess marinade. </li>
    <li>Combine romaine lettuce, bell pepper, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes in a salad bowl. Drizzle with tzatziki dressing and toss to coat. Divide salad into 4 equal portions and top with cooked chicken. </li>
  </ol>
